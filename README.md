# Emvc_Core
EasyMVC's Core class

This is the heart of the EasyMVC Framework!  

The repository 'easymvc' contains the structure and some pre-configured files of the Framework. Emvc_Core provides the logic behind it.

It's specially made for my framework, so it will be difficult to add this one to your own project. But if you want to try it, you can install the package through composer.
````
composer require easymvc/core
````

or by editing composer.json yourself and adding:
````
"require": {
    "easymvc/core": "*"
}
````

The only documentation provided will be in the class-file itself!
